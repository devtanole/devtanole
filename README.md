I'm a Full-Stack Developer with experience in React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. I decided to pivot away from my film studies due to the lack of stability as the pandemic threatened and halted a lot of productions. Although filmmaking and web development seem worlds apart, I feel as though my creativity and problem solving ability has translated over to my ability as a programmer. Those abilities, combined with the skills I picked up in the food service industry have allowed me to fit/work with everyone I have come across in my professional experience. <br/> <br/>
My most recent project, Punch It, a fullstack social application for regional/amateur fighters to promote themselves and create opportunities to find high profile fights was the most rewarding and challenging experience yet in my coding career and I cannot wait to learn more.
